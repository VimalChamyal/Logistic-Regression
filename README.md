# Logistic-Regression

Checkout my projects here, which utilize the most popular ML algo for classification problems - Logistic Regression. The projects demonstrate my solid understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis, Logistic Regression, Data preprocessing etc...

The projects that I have made are as follows :

1. Iris Flower Classification Project (Iris_Classification.ipynb)
2. Gender Classification (Gender_Classification.ipynb)

The 1st project (Iris Flower Classification) has a clean, widely known & small sized dataset (almost all the preprocessing steps are pre-applied) due to which it was little bit easier to implement the model/ make the project. The 2nd project (Gender Classification) has a large dataset & I also preprocessed it to make it suitable for training.

The projects demonstrate my solid understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis, Logistic Regression model & data pre-processing.
